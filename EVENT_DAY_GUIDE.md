## 🤖 **AUTOMATED FOLLOW-UPS (Admin Feature)**

**How It Works:**
When configured by your admin, Event Scout can automatically trigger follow-up workflows via webhooks.

**What Happens When You Scan a Card:**
1. You scan business card → Contact saved
2. **Webhook triggers automatically** → Sends contact info to n8n workflow
3. n8n can:
   - Send automated greeting email
   - Add to CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
   - Create follow-up tasks
   - Enrich contact data (LinkedIn, company info)
   - Schedule reminder emails

**Admin Setup (for team leads):**
1. Login as admin → Tap Admin nav button
2. Scroll to "Webhook Configuration"
3. Set `WEBHOOK_URL` in Railway environment variables (points to your n8n webhook)
4. Click "Test Webhook (Send Greeting)" to verify connection
5. Status indicator: 🟢 Green = configured, 🔴 Red = not set

**User Experience:**
- No extra steps required — works automatically
- Webhook failures are silent (doesn't block contact save)
- Admin can test webhook without affecting users

**Privacy:**
- Only contact data you scan is sent (not your personal profile)
- Webhook URL controlled by your organization
- No third-party services unless admin configures them
